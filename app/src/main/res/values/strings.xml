        \nBullying is a problem found in most schools. It is always there, and we want to help stop it.
        This storygame promotes bullying awareness. If you see someone being bullied, don\'t
        hesitate to report it to a teacher or other person in charge, if you don\'t want
        to step in.
        \nBe the change you want to see in the world.
